# mpesa-stk

The M-Pesa STK Push lifecycle, done properly. Daraja gives you "send a push" and "receive one callback" — this library is everything in between: idempotent initiation, atomic callback dedup, a polling fallback, and reconciliation.

TypeScript · Node 18+ · Postgres. STK Push only — no B2C, C2B, balance, or reversals.

## Why

Daraja's docs are a request/response spec. They stop where production starts. Pointed at the live sandbox, the API actually:

- re-fires the same callback multiple times under load — dedupe or you double-credit
- drops the callback entirely if your server blinks — no retry, no dead-letter
- rate-limits the STK Query (5 req/min in sandbox) and returns undocumented transient codes like `4999` mid-flight — a naive poller marks a still-pending payment FAILED
- masks the customer's phone number in 2026+ callbacks
- has no idempotency key — a double-tapped "Pay" sends two pushes and charges twice

Each of those is a wrong refund or a missed order waiting to happen. This library is that missing layer.

## Install

```bash
npm install mpesa-stk pg
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { MpesaStk, PostgresAdapter } from 'mpesa-stk'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

const adapter = new PostgresAdapter(new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }))
await adapter.migrate() // creates mpesa_payments; safe on every startup (IF NOT EXISTS)

const mpesa = new MpesaStk(
  {
    consumerKey:    process.env.MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY!,
    consumerSecret: process.env.MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET!,
    shortCode:      process.env.MPESA_SHORTCODE!,
    passKey:        process.env.MPESA_PASSKEY!,
    callbackUrl:    process.env.MPESA_CALLBACK_URL!,
    environment:    'sandbox',
  },
  adapter
)

// Fires once when a payment reaches a terminal state — via callback or poll
mpesa.onPaymentSettled(async (p) => console.log(p.id, p.status, p.mpesaReceiptNumber))

// idempotencyKey makes a retried/double-tapped request safe
const payment = await mpesa.initiatePayment({
  phoneNumber: '0712345678',
  amount: 500,
  accountReference: 'ORDER-123',
  description: 'Payment for ORDER-123',
  idempotencyKey: 'ORDER-123',
})

// Webhook route — ACK Safaricom first (within 5s), then process
app.post('/mpesa/callback', async (req, res) => {
  res.json({ ResultCode: 0, ResultDesc: 'Success' })
  await mpesa.processCallback(req.body)
})

// Reconcile on a schedule, not per request
await mpesa.reconcile(new Date(Date.now() - 864e5), new Date(Date.now() - 3e5))
```

Config: `timeoutMs` (75000), `pollIntervalMs` (5000 — base of the poll backoff), `maxPollAttempts` (10).

## How it works

- **Callback dedup** — `settlePayment` is one SQL compare-and-swap (`UPDATE … WHERE status = 'PENDING'`), not a read-then-check. Exactly one of N racing callbacks wins; `onPaymentSettled` fires once. The same guard covers poll-vs-callback.
- **Idempotent initiation** — concurrent same-key calls share one in-flight STK Push; across processes, a `UNIQUE` constraint on the key (written in the same `INSERT` as the record) is the backstop.
- **Poll fallback** — Fibonacci backoff from `pollIntervalMs` (5s → 10s → 15s → 25s → 30s), checks storage before each query, and settles only on a *known-terminal* code — transient/unknown codes keep waiting instead of failing a live payment.
- **Reconciliation** — checks every status, not just PENDING, because drift runs both ways:

| Your record | Daraja STK Query | What it means | `reconcile` result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | `SUCCESS` | callback + poll both missed it; customer paid | mismatch |
| `TIMEOUT` / `FAILED` | `SUCCESS` | you gave up or wrote it off, but money moved — the dangerous one (you may refund a paid order) | mismatch |
| `SUCCESS` | a failure code | a recorded success Daraja contradicts | mismatch |
| `SUCCESS` | no record / query error | possible ghost credit or spoofed callback | skipped (unverifiable) |
| any | transient `4999` / `429` | not yet determinable | skipped (re-run) |

Mismatches are returned, never auto-corrected — a stale query during a manual reversal would otherwise credit the wrong order. `reconcile` only settles drift it can *prove*; anything it can't verify is `skipped`, not guessed.

## Relay (optional)

Point Safaricom's `CallbackURL` at the relay instead of your app. It dedupes, persists, and redelivers one signed webhook with backoff (→ 30s → 2m → 10m → 30m → 2h → dead-letter), so a restart never loses a callback.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=… PORT=3000 npx mpesa-stk-relay
```

Safaricom doesn't sign callbacks; the relay does. Verify it, or anyone with your URL can POST fake successes:

```typescript
import { verifySignature } from 'mpesa-stk/server'

if (!verifySignature(rawBody, process.env.MPESA_RELAY_SECRET!, sig)) return res.status(401).end()
```
